# Stock Analysis 
## Overview of Project
### Purpose and Background
  The purpose and background of this project was to refactor a Microsoft Excel VBA code to run so that Steve could analyze the dataset for the entire stock market over the last few years. This information obtained would help Steve determine what other stocks his parents could invest in.
### Results
  The stocks had a much better return in 2017 than they did in 2018. The pictures below show the comparisons:

  The execution times appeared to be faster for the refactored code, compared to the original script.

### Summary
  1. The advantages of refactoring code is that it can make our code more organized and specific, all the while providing a lot of information. It also helps us find bugs when executing the code. The disadvantage to refactoring code is that it can be more time consuming than planned, and with all the details there is more room for error.  
  2. The biggest advantage I saw to refactoring the original VBA script is that the code ran much faster. The disadvantage that I experienced with refactoring the original VBA code was that there were a few times where I had to go back and change mistakes made, and had to keep retesting my code to eventually figure it out.
